## Description of Code 

* The goal is to analyze the data to determine the levels of PM2.5 polluting the air in a specific, chosen region in the United States. The user can manually select what region/ city they are searching for.
  
* To measure levels of PM2.5, the program returns the average levels of PM2.5 from the past two decades, along with returning a graph so we can observe the trend of the increase/ decrease of this pollutant (with hopes to train prediction models in the future).
